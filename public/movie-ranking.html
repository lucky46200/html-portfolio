<h3>Little Lord Fauntleroy</h3>
<p>Eight-year-old Cedric lives with his mother in New York. At first, he has no idea that his deceased father belonged to an old British aristocratic family. However, he has been disinherited by the marriage of a middle-class 
    American woman. One day, his grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, invites Cedric to England. He wants to get to know his only descendant and bring him up in a manner 
    befitting his station. However, the lovable boy has a surprising influence on the grumpy old man.</p>
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>Mark, a highly intelligent and shy computer nerd, hacks into his university 
    network one evening and publishes the information he finds about female students. 
    This is a huge success, which he is soon able to capitalise on by further developing the network. Years later, Mark Zuckerberg has built up an empire, but the road to this was 
    not only lined with support, but also with hostility, lawsuits and betrayal.</p>
<h3>Secret of my success</h3>
<p>
    Brantley Foster only wants one thing: to make it big in business in New York.
     So straight after college, but with no professional experience, he moves from a
      small town to the big city, where he hopes to make his fortune. However, nobody wants to give the young man a chance until his uncle Howard finally gives him a small job as a messenger. Under the pseudonym Carlton Whitfield, 
    he grabs an office and thus creates his own chance to prove himself.
